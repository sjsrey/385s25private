    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to GEOG 385: Spatial Data Analysis!\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods for diﬀerent types of spatial data with a particular focus on point processes and lattice (areal unit) data. Throughout the course you will gain valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to extend these methods in your own research.\nThe course takes an explicitly computational thinking approach to its pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational concepts and tools that are increasingly important to research that engages with geospatial data. By adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of, the substantive concepts. Put differently, students will learn to code. But this is a means to the end goal: students will code to learn spatial data analysis.\nIn the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful of the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As such, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead, the goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more common and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry point for further engagement with the field.",

    "text": "Grading\nGEOG 385 uses specification grading in evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade. The quality and quantity of your work will determine your course grade. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the concepts and methods covered in the course.\nThere is a two-step process for determination of your final course grade at the end of the quarter:\n\nUsing your quizzes and exercises, your base grade is determined.\nUsing your final exam results, determine if your base grade includes a \"plus\", \"minus\", or level drop to form the course grade.\n\n\nBase Grade\nFor Step 1, the base grade is determined using the following specification:\nThresholds for base grade:\n\n\n\nItem\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\nQuizzes\n12\n10\n8\n6\n\n\nExercises\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n\nYou must pass the both thresholds to obtain the base grade.\n\n\nFinal Grade\nFor Step 2, your final course grade is determined as follows:\n\nExam average 90 or above, “+” added to base grade\nExam average 75-89, no adjustment\nExam average 60-74, “-” added to base grade\nExam average &lt;60, one grade below base grade\n\nExamples of Final Grade Determination:\n\n\n\nExam\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n90+\nA\nB+\nC+\nD+\n\n\n75-89\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n60-74\nA-\nB-\nC-\nD-\n\n\n&lt;60\nB\nC\nD\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that SDSU grading policy does not allow A+ grades.

Each student will be assigned to a small group that works together to carry out a set of spatial data analysis tasks. At the end of the session each group will submit a single notebook demonstrating their work.\nEach notebook is graded using a CRN rubric that classifies work with marks of C (\"Demonstrates Competence\"), R (\"Needs Revision\"), or N (\"Not assessable\"):\nOf each notebook the following questions will be asked: Does the work demonstrate that the student understands the concepts? Does the work demonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the exercise?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to both of the questions, the group passes the hurdle for that studio.\nIf the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second question is asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the concepts? If the answer to this question is \"Yes\" the group can exchange one token (from each student) to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is \"No\", the group does not clear the hurdle for this exercise and will not have the opportunity to revise their work.\nFor our studio sessions on Wednesdays, it is essential that you bring your own device, such as a laptop or tablet. These sessions will involve hands-on activities that require access to software and online resources. Having your own device will allow you to fully participate and engage with the exercises. Please ensure your device is charged and ready to use at the start of each studio session. If you have any concerns about this requirement, please reach out to me in advance so we can make necessary arrangements.",

The essay should demonstrate your ability to analyze spatial data, identify patterns, and interpret the results using ESDA techniques.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Topic Selection\nSelect a topic of interest that involves spatial data. The topic should be relevant to your field of study or personal interest. Ensure that the data is accessible and suitable for spatial analysis. Submit your topic for approval by the instructor by September 30. If you are unsure about a topic, speak to the professor.\n\n\n2. Data Acquisition\nIdentify and acquire spatial data related to your chosen topic. This may include data from public repositories, government databases, or other reliable sources.\n\n\n3. ESDA Techniques\nApply appropriate ESDA methods such as spatial autocorrelation, clustering, and visualization techniques to explore your data. Use libraries like PySAL, GeoPandas, or others as needed.\n\n\n4. Analysis and Interpretation\nDocument your analysis in a Jupyter notebook. Include clear explanations of the methods used, the rationale behind your choices, and a discussion of your findings. Visualizations should be integrated into the narrative to support your analysis.\n\n\n5. Submission\nSubmit your Jupyter notebook along with a brief (500-word) reflection on what you learned from the analysis and how ESDA techniques enhanced your understanding of the topic. At submission you can indicate whether you wish to present your computational essay during the final period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must demonstrate competency on each of the stages above to have the computational essay count towards your base grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\nSubmit your completed essay by December 12, Midnight.",

Please know accommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received an accommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.\n\n\nPrivacy and Intellectual Property\nStudent Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student information, including contact information, grades, and graded assignments. I will use Canvas to communicate with you, and I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public places. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if copies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester or used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students maintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as part of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe SDSU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail. These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabotage, non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more information about the SDSU student academic integrity policy, please see the following: https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As a learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.\n\nAll communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in this course.\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this course.\nStudents violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and their violations will be reported to the SDSU administration.\n\nThis code of conduct is an adaptation of the SciPy 2018 Code of Conduct.",
